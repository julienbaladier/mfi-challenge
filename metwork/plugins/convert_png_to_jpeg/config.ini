# Notes about the name of the plugin:
# - the name of the plugin is given by the content of .layerapi2_label
#   in this directory (format: plugin_{name of the plugin}@mfdata)
# - the old "name" key in this file is not used anymore

# Version of the plugin (X.Y.Z)
# If the value is {{MFMODULE_VERSION}},
# the current module version is used
version=1.0.0

# Summary (one line) of the goal of the plugin
summary=Convert PNG files to JPEG

# License of the plugin
license=BSD

# URL of the plugin homepage
url=http://yourpluginhomepage

# Name of the maintainer of the plugin on the form "Firstname FAMILYNAME <email>"
maintainer=Julien BALADIER julien.baladier@gmail.com

# Vendor of the plugin
vendor=MetWork

# If you need a redis instance for your plugin for basic needs (no persistence,
# max of 0.5GB of memory), you can set redis_service key to 1.
# To connect to your instance, use an unix socket connection to
# the value of REDIS_SOCKET_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH env var.

#################################
# (one section [step_xxxxx] for each step)

# You can have several blocks [step_xxxx] if your plugin
# contains several steps.
# If you have only one step in your plugin, please use "main" as your
# step name in [step_xxxxx]. So just one [step_name] section in this case.

# If you have more than one step, use block step_section and included blocks
# for the first one and block extra_steps for the others

# You can use following placeholders:
# - {{ENV_VAR}}: replaced by the
#     corresponding env var.
# - {{MFDATA_CURRENT_PLUGIN_NAME}}: replaced by the plugin name
# - {{MFDATA_CURRENT_STEP_NAME}}: replaced by the step name
# - {{MFDATA_CURRENT_PLUGIN_DIR}}: replaced by the plugin
#     directory fullpath.
# - {{MFDATA_CURRENT_CONFIG_INI_PATH}}: replaced by this
#     file fullpath.
# - {{MFDATA_CURRENT_STEP_QUEUE}}: replaced by the name of
#     the queue for the plugin/step on redis
# - {{MFDATA_CURRENT_STEP_DIR}}: replaced by the step
#     directory

# KILL signal. It is not possible to catch a KILL signal so the worker will stop.
# If you use the standard Acquisition framework to implement your step, the

# You can add extra daemons which will be launched within your plugin
